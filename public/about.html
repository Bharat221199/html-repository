<h1>I am currently working at Infosys with 4.6 years of experience, primarily on an Order Entry project for Lumen. You're aiming for a career shift, and you’re chasing two big goals:</h1>

<h2>1. Become a Full Stack Developer (MERN)</h2>🚀 
<p>Enrolled in "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy

Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Git

Spending 1 hour/day to complete the course

Using a custom daily tracker for discipline & progress

End goal: Land a high-paying full stack job within 3 months</p>

<h2>2. Crack Infosys Power Programmer Role
Already part of Infosys, so aiming to crack the Bridge to Power Programmer (BPP)</h2>⚔️ 

<p>Working on Java + DSA (practicing with handpicked resources)

Targeting strong coding skills, OOPs concepts, and DSA to ace internal assessments

Also building a Power Programmer–oriented resume (we'll create that soon)</p>

<h2>Final Vision:</h2>🎯 
<p>Get out of night shifts, move to a better-paying job (internal or external), and build a long-term career as a developer with growth, recognition, and peace of mind 🌟</p>

<h3>You’ve got the vision, the drive, and now the right system. Let’s keep stacking those wins, one day at a time 💪</h3>
