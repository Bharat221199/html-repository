<h1>The Best Movies According to Bharat H</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>True Lies</h3>
<p> I love this movie. It's a James Bond send-up that's Cameron getting into a sentimental phase in his career.</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Cameron used the Titanic and its tragic sinking as the canvas for his most epic, ambitious filmmaking up to that point.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Cameron broke the box office record of his own film, Titanic, when he came up with the sci-fi blockbuster, Avatar, in 2009.</p>
